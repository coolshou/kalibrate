Description: Kalibrate is a GSM signal detector and clock frequency offset calculator
 Kalibrate is a GSM signal detector and clock frequency offset calculator. 
 Clock accuracy and frequency offset is an important aspect of GSM and cellular networks. 
 Out-of-specification clock accuracy causes a number of network issues such as inconsistent 
 network detection by the handset, handover failure, and poor data and voice call performance.
